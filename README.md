# discordworkout
An implementation of nSuns 5/3/1 workout program using Discord. Adaptable and functional, the program directly DMs users workout plans and allows them to dynamically adjust and modify their Training Maxes.

In the future, the program may even include other workout programs (I'm looking at Jim Wendler's Boring But Big or PHUL) but for now, it's only nSuns. Ping the Discord if you have any questions. 

This is the second iteration of this project, the first being viewable [here](https://github.com/gytanzo/workout).
